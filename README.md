The player has crashed on to a deserted island, but there is still hope to survive and escape the island. 
Parts of your boat have been scattered around the island but to get to them you’ll need various weapons/tools 
to help you get to them. Collect enough resources and process them so the player can craft weapons/tools to help. 
Though beware something dangerous lurks on this island.

they’ll just be one hit from death.

full they will be able to drop items and pick them up later. Dropped items will despawn after a certain amount of time. They can
also build a chest to store items.

# Dynamics
 The way the game should flow on is when the player first spawns they’ll have to collect enough resources to create basic tools
 and weapons. Which by then night will fall and they will have to fight enemies off. After the first night the player can start
 moving towards finding their ship parts, marked by the map. Then the player will have to platform to get to their missing ship
 parts but they might be missing resources to reach the boat part. So the player will go collect more resources. Which by then
 night will fall and they’ll have to fight more enemies.
